# 🚀 Sync and Solve

*“Collect. Unlock. Launch. Home awaits.”* ✨

**Sync and Solve** is a Unity 2D platformer where you guide a stranded astronaut 👨‍🚀 through puzzles, enemies, 
and obstacles to **fuel the rocket and go home**. Each level challenges you to think, move, and react in sync — 
solve the puzzles, avoid dangers, and launch your way back to safety.
